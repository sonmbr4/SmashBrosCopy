Linux Users:

Before you can run SSF2, you may need to add the "data" folder as a Trusted Location in your Flash Player Settings. See below:

1) Launch SSF2 by running the "SSF2" executable file provided. If the loading screen gets stuck, proceed to Step 2 for steps to fix (special thanks to Davo for discovering this new & improved workaround). Otherwise you're already good to go.

2) In your file explorer, open the folder where you have extracted the Linux version of SSF2

3) In this folder you should see a script named "trust-ssf2.sh".

4) Right click an empty space within this folder and click "Open in Terminal" to open your terminal to the right folder. 

5) Enable the script to be executed using: "chmod u+x trust-ssf2.sh"

6) Run the script using the command: "./trust-ssf2.sh", and close the terminal

7) Restart SSF2 and it will load beyond 5%!!!


(If you have issues with the launcher, you can also rename the "run" file in the data folder to "run.swf", and drag it into your internet browser if you still have a browser that supports playing SWF files directly.)
